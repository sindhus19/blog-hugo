Krishna is a major deity in Hinduism. His iconography reflects and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing the flute, a young boy with Radha or surrounded by women devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna. People portray him in various perspectives: a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and as the universal supreme being, and he is usually depicted with a flute in his hand.
