My Journey started when I was 6 and I started my Imaginations 2 Creation channel and did Arm Knitting videos.
Quarantine gave me an opportunity to slow down and think on what I wanted to accomplish with my free time. I was looking in to ways for combining my passion for creative arts and teaching others. I decided on focusing on creating a bigger impact and reaching far more people than making money with select few. To acheive this goal, I have to build a huge userbase and then make the sessions and content interesting to sustain their interest and to keep them coming back.

My goal is to connect to a large group of auidence than few and I even had to put on hold requsts for private sessions. The larger the audience the more impact I have inspiring lot of people to find their passion and hone on it. This gives me lot of satisfaction for my hardwork.

To connect to kids and cater different interest levels I started working on doing sessions on Realistic Art, Finger Knitting, Arm Knitting, Oragami, Story Time, Oil Pastels, Painting, Hair Styling, and Motivational Speeches. I am gifted with these talents but defintely my passion and hardwork is what made me today. Sometimes I have to practice 2 or 3 times and spend hours before Live session to make it easier for others. My sessions got so successful early on and far reaching. I have 100+ people registered for my Story time. I started seeing the same people joining all my different sessions which increased in my confidence that I am insipiring them which made me work even harder to keep my sessions more interesting and engaging. Seeing my sessions, admins from different Home schooling groups and private Facebook groups reached out to me and I did private sessions for their members which ranged from 600 to 3200 members. I even started doing private zoom parties for people on their special occassions like their birthdays to teach them art sessions to make it more special. 

I started doing Story times for younger kids and after the story we talk about the Moral and what we can take away from the story and apply it in our lives. Then we do a fun interactive session of drawing characters from the story. This experience and all my sessions helped me grow and improve my communication skills, develop patience when dealing with other people and understand different perspectives. Facebook live sessions pose additional challenges like there is no-redo we need to be perfect the first time and you need to balance all levels of skilled audience where sometimes few people wants me to slow down and others wants me to move fast. I developed skills to keep them engaged and balanced and remind them always that any creative learning takes patience and they need to be patient with each other and respect them and not to be mean to each other in comments.

This experienced as shown me that we always need to follow our passion, Dream Big and work really hard to make it a reality and Everything is possible in this world.
